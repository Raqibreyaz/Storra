  {
    q: "What happens if my payment fails?",
    a: "Razorpay retries the charge automatically. Storra gives you a grace period (a few days) during which you retain full access. If the charge still fails after the grace period, your account is moved to a restricted state and uploads are paused until billing is resolved.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I downgrade if I'm over the new plan's limit?",
    a: "Yes, but you won't be able to upload new files until your stored data is within the new plan's quota. Existing files are never deleted automatically — you stay in control of what to remove.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a free plan?",
    a: "Yes. The free plan gives you 100 MB of storage with no credit card required. You can upgrade to a paid plan at any time directly from your dashboard.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you proxy file data through your servers?",
    a: "No. Storra uses presigned S3 URLs, so your files travel directly from your browser to AWS S3. Our servers only sign the upload URL and record metadata — they never see or store the file bytes themselves.",
